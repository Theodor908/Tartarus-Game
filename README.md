# Tartarus-Game

### College Project

**Tartarus** is a Soulslike game developed in Unity, featuring the basic elements of the genre. Please note, there is no controls menu or in-game instructions provided. Known issues include enemies occasionally hovering above the player during collisions (unresolved) and fleeing unexpectedly. Despite the game becoming somewhat messy and hard to manage as it grew, it was a valuable learning experience and remains a success in terms of functionality.

### Features
- **Title screen** with load functionality.

- **Health, stamina, and focus bars**. The game includes a sword, shield, and two additional weapons dropped by enemies. There's one special spell, along with health and focus potions. A menu, activated by pressing **F**, allows players to assign items to quick slots. Additionally, there's an upgrade system for status bars.
