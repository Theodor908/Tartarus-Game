# Tartarus-Game
College project
A Soulslike game made with Unity, featuring the basic elements of the genre. There are no instructions provided. Enemies may occasionally hover above the player when they collide, an issue I couldn’t resolve, and they might also flee in fear. Overall, it was a good learning project, but it became messy and difficult to manage. In terms of functionality, however, it’s a success.
